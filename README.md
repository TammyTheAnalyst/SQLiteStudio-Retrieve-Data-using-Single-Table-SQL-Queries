# SQL-Projects

This repository showcases various SQL projects I have completed, demonstrating my ability to write SQL queries for different use cases, including filtering data, sorting, and using different SQL clauses.

## Project: Retrieve Data using Single-Table SQL Queries

For this project, I used **SQLiteStudio** to practice retrieving data from a database using single-table SQL queries. I focused on writing queries to control which data was retrieved based on different conditions and requirements. Here are the key concepts I worked on:

### Key Concepts I Worked On:

### The SELECT * from Statement
In this section, I practiced using the SELECT * FROM statement to retrieve all columns and rows from a specified table in the database.

### Projection Query
In this section, I learned about **projection** in SQL. Projection refers to choosing specific columns from a table instead of selecting all columns. This helps focus on the most relevant data.

### The ORDER BY Clause
I worked on using the ORDER BY clause to rearrange the order of rows in the output returned from a query. This allowed me to organize the data in ascending or descending order based on specific columns.

### The WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records and return only those rows that meet specific conditions. I used this clause to limit which rows were included in the query output, focusing on data that met certain criteria.

### The Combination WHERE Clause
In some cases, I needed to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. This allowed me to create more specific queries using logical operators like AND and OR to meet more complex filtering requirements.

### Saving and Reusing Queries
In this project, I learned how to save queries in SQLiteStudio and reuse them for later use. By saving queries, I was able to quickly rerun complex SQL statements without having to rewrite them each time, improving efficiency in my workflow.
