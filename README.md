# SQL-Projects

This repository showcases various SQL projects I have completed, demonstrating my ability to write SQL queries for different use cases, including filtering data, sorting, and using different SQL clauses.

## Project: Retrieve Data using Single-Table SQL Queries

For this project, I used **SQLiteStudio** to practice retrieving data from a database using single-table SQL queries. I focused on writing queries to control which data was retrieved based on different conditions and requirements. Here are the key concepts I worked on:

### Key Concepts I Worked On:
  
- **The SELECT Clause**  
   In this section, I practiced using the `SELECT` clause to control which columns are returned from a query.

- **The ORDER BY Clause**
   I worked on using the ORDER BY clause to rearrange the order of rows in the output returned from a query.

- **The WHERE Clause**
   The WHERE clause is used to filter records and return only those rows that meet specific conditions. I used this clause to limit which rows were included in the query output.

- **The Combination WHERE Clause**
   In some cases, I needed to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. This allowed me to create more specific queries with AND, OR, and other logical operators.

- **Saving and Reusing Queries**  
   In this project, I learned how to save queries in **SQLiteStudio** and reuse them for later use.
